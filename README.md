Inventory
=========
This is a part of my experient with angular.js. Here you can add product, its price, category and description to inventory. It has no backend support and is simply storing data in array in controller.After adding data the items are getting pushed into the array 

you can perform following three thing:-
1) add new item to inventory.
2) edit existing
3) delete existing.

Its is experimental and new changes can be added as and when i get time
